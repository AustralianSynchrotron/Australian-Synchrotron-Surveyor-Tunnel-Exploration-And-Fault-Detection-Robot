(also http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/how-to-build-and-run-mjpg-streamer-on-the-raspberry-pi)


1. apt-get install subversion lib4vl-dev libjpeg8-dev imagemagick
2. svn checkout svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/mjpg-streamer/code/ mjpg-streamer-code
3. cd mjpg-streamer/mjpg-streamer-experimental
4. sudo ln -s /usr/include/linux/videodev2.h /usr/include/linux/videodev.h
5. make USE_LIBV4L2=true clean all
6. sudo make DESTDIR=/usr install

7. test...
sudo mjpg_streamer -i "input_uvc.so -d /dev/video6 -n -r 640x480 -f 1" -o "output_http.so -n -p 8090 -w /usr/www"

Note: it seems that the uvc drivers can only handle a device in the range video0 through to video9. 
On this box the webcam was coming up on video14 so was not able to open the device for reading. The "fix"
was to add a udev rule to map the device to videoA. see 83-webcam.rules
